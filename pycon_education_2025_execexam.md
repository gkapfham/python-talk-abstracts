# "ExecExam: A Tool to Facilitate Effective Executable Examinations in Python"

## Abstract

An executable examinations invites a learner to write, modify, and/or execute
Python source code to solve well-specified programming problems. This type of
assessment enables teachers to determine whether or not a learner can
effectively use a suite of software development tools to implement a program
that meets a specification. After highlighting the challenges associated with
delivering and assessing executable examinations at scale, this presentation
introduces ExecExam, a tool that streamlines and automates the assessment of
Python programs. Leveraging an integration with both local and cloud-based LLMs,
ExecExam provides sophisticated, context-aware feedback for failing Pytest
tests, guiding students towards the effective resolution of errors while
fostering a deeper understanding of Python programming concepts. Instead of
receiving output from a single failed test assertion, students using ExecExam
see a detailed report of all failing checks and specific suggestions for code
fixes or alternative approaches that will enable the student's project to pass
the tests. In addition to overviewing the design and implementation of ExecExam,
this talk will equip teachers with the knowledge needed to deploy their own
executable examinations with the ExecExam tool. More details about the ExecExam
tool is available in its GitHub repository at
https://github.com/GatorEducator/execexam.
