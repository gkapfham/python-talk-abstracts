# "Up and Running with GitHub, GitHub Classroom, and GitHub Actions"

## Abstract

Instructors who teach students how to program in Python are often confronted by
the practical challenges of distributing an assignment, collecting the
submissions from students, offering automated insights on solution quality, and
then furnishing a final assessment of a student's work. This presentation
introduces how to use GitHub, GitHub Classroom, and GitHub Actions to create a
realistic and easy-to-use workflow for managing Python programming assignments.
Leveraging screenshots, example commands, and tool suggestions, this talk will
succinctly explain, from start to finish, how to create an assignment in GitHub
Classroom. Along with overview lessons learned from the use of GitHub Classroom
across multiple semesters, this talk will equip teachers with the knowledge and
skills that they will need to start using GitHub Classroom in their next class.

## Key Takeaways

- Understand the benefits of using version control, Git, and GitHub
- Create a solution to a Python programming project with passing automated checks
- Create a starter solution remove implementation and purposefully failing checks
