# "Up and Running with GitHub, GitHub Classroom, and GitHub Actions"

## Abstract

Instructors who invite their students to complete programming assignments often
need automated tools to confirm that a submission meets the stated requirements.
Although it is possible to use regular expressions or abstract syntax tree
parsing to perform these types of checks, these approaches are often either
error-prone or time-consuming to build. This talk presents Chasten, a Python
tool that offers an elegant solution by leveraging XPath expressions to search
Python's abstract syntax tree, making static code analysis both powerful and
accessible. This presentation explains how teachers can implement custom linting
rules, enforce coding standards, and perform sophisticated pattern matching on a
student's Python programming project. More details about freely available and
open-source Chasten tool are available at:
