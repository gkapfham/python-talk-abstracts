# "Building and Deploying Course Web Sites with Python, Quarto, and Mkdocs"

## Abstract

Instructors who teach students how to program in Python are often confronted by
the practical challenges of distributing an assignment, collecting the
submissions from students, offering automated insights on solution quality, and
then furnishing a final assessment of a student's work. This presentation
introduces how to use GitHub, GitHub Classroom, and GitHub Actions to create a
realistic and easy-to-use workflow for managing Python programming assignments.
Leveraging screenshots, example commands, and tool suggestions, this talk will
succinctly explain, from start to finish, how to create an assignment in GitHub
Classroom. Along with overview lessons learned from the use of GitHub Classroom
across multiple semesters, this talk will equip teachers with the knowledge and
skills that they will need to start using GitHub Classroom in their next class.

## Key Takeaways

- Understand the benefits of using version control, Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions
- Create a solution to a Python programming project with passing automated checks
- Use implementation ablation to design a starter with purposefully failing checks
- Create a GitHub Classroom assignment using the GitHub repository for the starter
- Invite students to the complete the assignment through GitHub Classroom
- Offer automated feedback using GitHub Actions and automated checking tools
- Furnish comprehensive feedback through the use of GitHub issues and pull requests
