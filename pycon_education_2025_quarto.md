# "Building and Deploying Course Websites with Python, Quarto, and Mkdocs"

## Abstract

Creating effective course websites for teaching programming requires balancing
technical depth, pedagogical clarity, and user experience. This presentation
shares practical insights from the development of multiple Python-focused course
websites using both Quarto and Material for Mkdocs. In addition to overviewing
the features provided by both platforms, this talk will demonstrate how to
create components such as executable Python source code and presentation slides.
Through concrete examples from course websites created by the presenter for
diverse fields such as algorithm analysis, computer security, and software
engineering, the talk will highlight implementation decisions, workflow
improvements, and lessons learned from years of iterative refinement. While the
presentation will demonstrate the benefits of Quarto's bundled suite of tools,
it will also explore exciting new developments in Material for Mkdocs that may
make it a compelling alternative for educators who need to build a course site.

## Key Takeaways

- Understand the relative strengths of Quarto and Material for Mkdocs for course websites
- Create consistent course websites featuring documentation and presentation slides
- Design an automated deployment workflow for course websites using GitHub Actions
- Structure course content to maximize student engagement and accessibility
- Integrate Python programming examples that students can run directly in the browser
- Apply lessons learned from managing many technical course websites across different domains
