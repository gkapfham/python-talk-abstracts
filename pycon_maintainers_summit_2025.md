# Flaky Tests are a Fiasco! Practical Strategies for Maintainers to Handle of Test Flakiness

## Abstract

When test cases fail inconsistently without changes to the code under test they
are flaky. These flaky tests do not clearly indicate the presence or absence of
software bugs and thus limit the effectiveness of software maintainers. After
giving concrete examples of flaky tests in real-world Python projects, this talk
overviews the results from a developer survey finding that 59% claimed to deal
with flaky tests on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis. After explaining why
automated test rerunning may not find flaky tests, this talk shows how machine
learning techniques can automatically find flaky tests, thereby taming the
fiasco of flaky tests for software maintainers.
