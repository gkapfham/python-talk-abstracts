# Flaky Tests are a Fiasco! Practical Strategies for Maintainers to Handle of Test Flakiness

## Abstract

When test cases fail inconsistently without changes to the code under test they
are flaky. These tests do not clearly indicate the presence or absence of
software bugs and thus limit the effectiveness of software maintainers. Since a
recent survey of software developers found that 59% claimed to deal with flaky
tests on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis, this talk overviews the challenges
presented by flaky tests and presents practical strategies that maintainers can
adopt to handle test flakiness. Along with overviewing the insights on flaky
tests from a recent developer survey, this talk will explain how automated
rerunning may not find flaky tests and show how machine learning algorithms
can automatically find flaky tests for busy software maintainers.
