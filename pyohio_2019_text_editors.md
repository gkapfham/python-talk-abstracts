# Find Your Feature Fit: How to Pick a Text Editor for Python Programming

## Brief Description

What is important to you when it comes to text editors? To find out, join us in
comparing VS Code and Vim. From version control integration to source code
highlighting, with auto-completion, testing, virtual environments, snippets,
code navigation and linting in between, learn how VS Code and Vim handle each
feature and decide for yourself what fits your programming preferences when
using Python.

## Full Description

This presentation will explore the different features of text editors for Python
programming. By comparing the capabilities of VS Code and Vim, audiences of all
skill levels will receive the necessary information to make an informed decision
about which text editor fits their programming preferences. Using a day in the
life of a Python programmer as a guide, the talk will introduce and compare
features including fuzzy file finding and code navigation, auto-completion,
source code highlighting, linting, testing, virtual environments, and snippets.
For VS Code and Vim, these selected features showcase what is most important to
a Python programmer, highlighting the trade-offs and benefits of both text
editors. Using a Pytest plugin as an illustrative example, here are some topics
that we will cover in this presentation:

- **Fuzzy File Finding**: Rapidly search for files in your project with names
  that match a pattern.

- **Source Code Highlighting**: Bring clarity by applying colors and fonts to
  your source code and technical writing.

- **Autocompletion**: Save time by quickly substituting partial code and text
  segments with the desired content.

- **Linting and Code Formatting**: Check and reformat source code and writing to
  ensure adherence to well-established style guides.

- **Virtual Environments and Packages**: Maintain project isolation by
  installing and managing packages in separate development and execution
  environments.

- **Automated Testing and Debugging**: Establish a confidence in program
  correctness by running test suites and finding and fixing bugs.

- **Code Snippets**: Save time when programming and testing by inserting full
  segments based on easy-to-complete keywords.

Ultimately, this presentation will demonstrate that both VS Code and Vim are
outstanding text editors for Python, with features that can assist in many
everyday programming tasks. In different ways, and possibly with different
disadvantages or benefits, these text editors improve a programmer's efficiency
and effectiveness, becoming an indispensable part of a workflow. With the
knowledge of the features that VS Code and Vim offer, the audience will be able
to choose which editor is best for them, emerging with the know-how to configure
it to their preferences for Python programming. Both beginners and experts alike
will be capable of finding their feature fit for a text editor that supports
Python programming!
