# Find Your Feature Fit: How to Pick a Text Editor for Python Programming

## Brief Description

What is important to you when it comes to text editors? To find out, join us in
comparing VS Code and Vim. From version control integration to source code
highlighting, with auto-completion, testing, virtual environments, snippets,
code navigation and linting in between, learn how VS Code and Vim handle each
feature and decide for yourself what fits your programming preferences when
using Python.

## Full Description

This presentation will explore the different features of text editors for Python
programming. By comparing the capabilities of VS Code and Vim, audiences of all
skill levels will receive the necessary information to make an informed decision
about which text editor fits their programming preferences. Using a day in the
life of a Python programmer as a guide, the talk will introduce and compare
features including fuzzy file finding and code navigation, auto-completion,
source code highlighting, linting, testing, virtual environments, and snippets.
For VS Code and Vim, these selected features showcase what is most important to
a Python programmer, highlighting the trade-offs and benefits of both text
editors.

Fuzzy file finding—the ability to open a file automatically through searching
one or more words associated with a specific name—is an essential feature for
programmers. Microsoft has an extension which makes fuzzy file searching
accessible for Visual Studio Code users. The most popular Vim plugins for this
feature are ctrlp.vim and FZF, which are both widely accessible. For both VScode
and Vim, fuzzy file finding is comparable in usage, making both text editors
effective in enhancing a Python programmer’s workflow. Another feature related
to fuzzy file finding is code navigation. Both Visual Studio Code and Vim have
features for code navigation. With that said, code navigation in VS Code is
easier to use and configure. than the feature for Vim through valuable how-to
guides and a simple user interface.

In contrast to fuzzy file searching, auto-completion is a feature for which VS
Code is emerges as the current winner over Vim. With Microsoft’s implementation
of IntelliSense—their own Language Server Protocol or LSP—in addition to an
easy-to-install extension for Python, auto-completion with Visual Studio Code
makes the code-writing process much smoother. IntelliSense provides code
completions that are based on an analysis of source code, along with the
language semantics of a programmer’s code. This feature is almost incomparable
to the plugins required for Vim auto-completion features, or it’s LSP, which is
still in its infancy.

A feature of Vim that is far past its infancy—and has transcended well into a
necessity—is source code highlighting. Often overlooked when considering the
essentials of Python programming, source code highlighting can assist
tremendously when a programmer reviews code. In Visual Studio Code and Vim,
source code highlighting is available through simple extensions, though Vim
provides a much more configurable version. With that said, VSCode furnishes a
more user-friendly interface for setting exact requirements for highlighting.
Even with a slightly higher learning curve, Vim’s extensive highlighting
configurations are worth it.

Linting and automated code formatting are features used by many programmers in
the Python community. The ability of a plugin to access code and format it by
parameters set by the programmer is essential in maintaining readability. Python
linters must be enabled. Yet, after this is done, a simple command can run
through the code and find and present the problems associated with that specific
code. Though Visual Studio Code linter cannot directly change the problem areas
of code, it is a useful feature. Linting with Vim has to be run using a plugin
like the asynchronous linting engine (ALE). This fact alone could lead to the
determination that VS Code is simpler in terms of linting, though certain
plugins for Vim are much more helpful than VS Code Python linting. In most cases
of Vim linting plugins, not only is the erroneous code pointed out, but it is
also automatically fixed. With that said, both VS Code and Vim support
integration with the Black tool for automated code formatting. In comparison to
VS Code, Vim arguably provides a more effective approach to linting and
automated code formatting.

A feature where there is no clear indication of a forerunner when comparing
VSCode and Vim is testing. Testing, an integral part of Python programming, can
range from running one test case to one test suite to multiple test suites. Both
VS Code and Vim are excellent at enabling programmers to do each of these tests,
and also provide a mechanism to record and present which tests pass and which
tests fail. With Visual Studio Code, the testing extension provides full access
to the VS Code API, which can run without a VS Code instance. Vim testing is
enabled through various plugins, all which run quickly and efficiently. Test.vim
is a well-used plugin that provides an abstraction of many different tests over
the command line, including, for instance, Nose, Pytest, and PyUnit for the
Python programming language.

Since Virtual environments are an integral part of Python programming, it is
nice to see that both VS Code and Vim provide support to, for instance, create
and destroy virtual environments and install and managing package dependencies.
This presentation will highlight how tools like pip and pipenv integrate with
both text editors, ultimately revealing that the feature sets for the two text
editors are comparable.

Snippets are a feature that is highly configurable by both Visual Studio Code
and Vim. As a mechanism that associates keywords with programmable blocks that
are then “filled in” to code segments, snippets must have the ability to be
developed by the programmer. This can be done as another feature of Microsoft
IntelliSense in VS Code and several Vim plugins. Snippets help to save time when
writing code, along with assisting in avoidance of mistakes. Snippets make
Python programming more efficient and more effective, whether VS Code or Vim is
used.

VS Code and Vim are outstanding text editors for Python, with features that can
assist in everyday programming tasks. In different ways, and possibly with
different disadvantages or benefits, these text editors improve efficiency,
effectiveness, readability, workflow, and code review. With this knowledge of
features that VS Code and Vim offer, the audience will be able to choose which
editor is best for them, emerging with the know-how to configure it to their
Python preferences. Both beginners and experts alike will be capable of finding
their feature fit for a text editor to support Python programming!
