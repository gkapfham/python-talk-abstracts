# python-talk-abstracts

This repository contains Markdown files of the abstracts for talks that I,
[Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/), have given at
Python-related conferences. I am making these available to the community so that
others can review the details of talks accepted to this type of conference.
Whenever appropriate, I have updated the abstracts to make references to the
most up-to-date web sites and GitHub repositories.

This is a summary of the files containing abstracts for talks that I have given
at Python-related conferences:

  Development](pycon_2018_collaborative_software.md)
