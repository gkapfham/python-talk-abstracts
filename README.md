# python-talk-abstracts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gkapfham/python-talk-abstracts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gkapfham/python-talk-abstracts)

This repository contains Markdown files of the abstracts for talks that I,
[Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/), have given at
Python-related conferences, often in collaboration with my students and
colleagues. I am making these available to the community so that others can
review the details of talks accepted to this type of conference. Whenever
appropriate, I have enhanced the abstracts to make references to the most
up-to-date web sites and GitHub repositories.

This is a summary of the files containing abstracts for talks that I have given
at Python-related conferences:

- [PyCon 2018 Education Summit: Using GitHub, Travis CI, and Python to
  Introduce Collaborative Software
  Development](pycon_2018_collaborative_software.md)

- [PyOhio 2018: A Hands-On Guide to Teaching Programming with GitHub, Travis
  CI, and Python](pyohio_2018_teaching_programming.md)
