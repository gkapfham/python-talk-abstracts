# python-talk-abstracts

![Build](https://github.com/gkapfham/www.gregorykapfhammer.com/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains Markdown files of the abstracts for talks that I,
[Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/), have given at
Python-related and industry-oriented conferences, often in collaboration with
my students and colleagues. I am making these available to the community so
that others can review the details of talks accepted to this type of
conference. Whenever appropriate, I have enhanced the abstracts to make
references to the most up-to-date web sites and GitHub repositories.

This is a summary of the files containing abstracts for talks that I have given
at Python-related conferences:
